            About True Echoes
        </div>
        <p class="mt-6 m-2 lg:mx-6 lg:text-2xl">
            True Echoes is a research project that aims to reconnect a rich
            archive of early sound recordings of cultures from the Pacific
            region with the communities from which they originate.
        </p>
        <p class="m-2 lg:mx-6 lg:text-2xl">
            True Echoes uses digitised wax cylinder recordings that date from
            the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and which represent some of
            the earliest uses of sound in anthropological research.
        </p>
        <p class="m-2 lg:mx-6 lg:text-2xl">
            Beginning with recordings made in 1898 by members of the Cambridge
            Anthropological Expedition to Torres Straits, the wax cylinder
            collection held by the British Library Sound Archive also includes
            recordings made in Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu,
            New Caledonia and Australia.
        </p>
        <p class="m-2 lg:mx-6 lg:text-2xl">
            These rare recordings are hugely significant as the earliest
            documents of oral traditions from Oceanic communities.
        </p>
        <p class="m-2 lg:mx-6 lg:text-2xl">
            True Echoes is working with cultural and research institutions in
            the region and in the UK to enhance the visibility and accessibility
            of these collections, ensuring that they are catalogued in ways that
            are accessible to the communities whose heritage they represent.
